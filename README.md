## note
![](markers.jpg)
those above are called conflict markers, added by git to the working directory when there's a merge conflict, meant as an aid to resolving the conflict before committing. if you ever to to actually stage and commit text like that, git won't stop you, but it's never the right thing to do.

although, running into this the first day with git is a good sign of trying things out without being too scared of doing it wrong üëç
